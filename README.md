# SHA-256

#### What Is Sha-256
<hr/>

Secure Hash Algorithm 256 or SHA 256 is defined as one of the most secure ways to protect digital information. 
SHA 256 is a math process that generates a 256 bit (64 character long) random sequence of letters and numbers 
(hash) out of any input.

A hash is not ‘encryption’ – it cannot be decrypted back to the original text (it is a ‘one-way’ cryptographic function, and 
is a fixed size for any size of source text). This makes it suitable when it is appropriate to compare ‘hashed’ versions of texts,
as opposed to decrypting the text to obtain the original version.
